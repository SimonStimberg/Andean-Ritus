  https://omimi.tanigami.wtf/get-smooth-with-ken-perlin-on-max-msp-337630ecd2ad
  
* a list with MIDI notes to Piano Notes (was one octave off when tried)

* linked MAX patch with Unity and made a sphere appear at the corresponding sound location in space.
* engineerd the OSC script in Unity so that it can also send OSC messages in addition to receiving
  * based on the scripts from this project: https://github.com/heaversm/unity-osc-receiver
    * (seems to be the project the weimar script is derived from)
    * also with video tutorial https://vimeo.com/95584442  (but without tackling the OSC-send part)
* worked out to read the camera position in Unity and send it to Max to use it for correct spatialisation
* worked out to get the rotation of the camamera and pass it on too (and learned about quaternation!)
  * a nice blog entry to dig further if desired: https://developerblog.myo.com/quaternions/
* so now with "headtracking" available, audio spatialisation works pretty fair
* had to disable the doppler effect in the spatializer because of the artifacts concerning fast the displacement of the sounds
  * nevertheless orientation seems to work better with doppler turned on (-> more natural?)
  * would be possible if using only one place per sequencer (= one spatializer instance for each sound=
* tackling the unsync problems of the Max metronome - useful forum discussion: https://cycling74.com/forums/cpu-usage-problems/
  * turned schedular overdrive on and reduced the refresh rate to 10ms - seemed to improve - further testing needed

### 19. March 2019 ###  


* checked out the Live-Sequencer Object (live.step) in MAX/MSP
  * words perfectly for the purpose - a bit complicate syntax but you can determine a lot
  * you can have at least up to 16 voices playing parallel
  * there are 5 parameters: pitch, velocity, duration and extra1, extra2 which are customizable
* build a random note generator which writes a random note on the sequencer grid
 
 .
  
* downloaded a binaural patch which works surprisingly good  
  http://jakobhandersen.dk/projects/fft-based-binaural-panner/download/
* implemented the simple version with the sequencer
  * signal vector size has to be set to 1024 and samplerate to 44.1k (in the audio settings)
  * so when a note is genereated, it generates random direction values
    * Azimuth -> 180째 left/right (in 72 steps)
    * Elevation -> 360째 front/up/back/down (in 127 steps)
* also implemented the more sophisticated version with x/y/z coordinates and delay/doppler effect for distance experience
  * didn't work so well with the mellow synthesizer sounds
    * doppler effect between sounds -> interprets virtual movements -> new spatial position for every note
  * hopefully with headtracking and the visual input the spatial experience is improved
   
.
   
* Idea: maybe the sounds/objects should move instead of having a fixed position
  * depends on visual style (requires objects rather than glitches)
  
.
  
* decision: doing the sound entirely in MAX
* also the calculation and generation
  * only sending head tracking and position information from Unity to MAX and position of the sounds back to Unity

### 27. February 2019 ###  

brainstormed about musical concept  
* algorithmic/serial composition 
* no classic electronic music elements (such as bass/pad/lead..)
  * rather multiple sound events, that are synced to a pulse (timegrid) which form through theri interplay, musical patterns
    * -> twelve tone music?
* but still ritual/hypnotic/trance inducing feeling
  * techno-loops, sequencing / westafrican ritual music  

**Interesting Inspirations**   

Step Sequencer in Max/MSP  
https://audiocookbook.org/step-sequencer-built-in-maxmsp/  
  
Celular Automaton (e.g. Conways Game of Life)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life  
  
Asked Mischa to maybe participate in "composing" the music.

### 19. February 2019 ###  
* played around with max
  * there is a "analogue drum computer" entirely synthesized in max - sounds nice - every aspect is possible to manipulate
  * tryed to setup a pulse/metronome - to generate some kind of sequencer - in the end a prefab would work better
  
* implemented VomHauptplatz Mouseview script - works better!

* one thought for visual effects:
  * more/bigger mirrors in the scene then rotate the world -> psychedelic mirroring effect

* another thought - if there were a video buffer to write in max and display in unity, would be fancy
  * but if its possibly at all would be to complicated

* a possible solution to download equirectangular 360째-Videos from YouTube instead of their cubemap format:
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/15267
  * needs youtube-dl - best to install maybe homebrew first..
  
* concluded to just start doing something - rather than thinking how it could look or sound and beeing afraid from starting the wrong way

### 29. January 2019 ###  
* found a free 3 month licence for MaxMSP yay!

* played around with the seaboard - understood conventions and constraints of the midi protocol and the signal flow in Max/MSP  (one has to prepend a 144 before the midi notes - dont know why yet--)
https://cycling74.com/forums/sending-midi-notes-to-vst-synth

* found out how to handle the multidimensional polyphonic expression (MPE), transmitted by the seaboard:

https://rolisupport.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/36000027933-what-is-mpe-

* tried to access the post processing behaviour in unity via a script, but realized that its far more complicated

### 22. January 2019 ###  
* added a better mirror material through a script and a shader after this tutorial:  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD9LfpRH5Z4  
  script resource:  
  http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/MirrorReflection4  
  
  Mirror Material and script have to be put both on an object to be reflective  
  seems that it has to be attached to a plane to work the best way. (rather then volumetric shapes)  
  
* added a simple and working FreeFly Camera Script  
  possible now to look around with the mouse and move via the WASD keys  
  resource:  
  https://gist.github.com/gunderson/d7f096bd07874f31671306318019d996  
  (resp. used a modified version by Ryan Breaker found in the comments below)  
  
* played around with post-processing profile > trippy results  
  (e.g. motion blur: increase frame blending / chrom aberration: up to max / color grading: hue shifting around)  
  
  found some resources in order to automate the behaviour.  
  unity-manual:  
  https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Manipulating-the-Stack  
  a promising forum post:  
  https://answers.unity.com/questions/1355103/modifying-the-new-post-processing-stack-through-co.html  
  
  got to be revised next time!

### 13. January 2019 ###  
installed Unity at Workstation at home.  
(Version 2017.4.18f because 2018 requires at least OSX 10.11) 

* Added Video-Test-World project.  
* Wrote a script that slightly transforms the World-Sphere (with 360째-Video)
  and moves the ground subtle -> psychedelic effect!
  
Also installed Max 7.3.6  
(Max 8 also doesn't run on OSX 10.10)

*Breakthrough: Audio Bridge WORKING*    
Using **Jack Audio for Unity**:
* reason not clear - maybe application start order crucial:
  1. Start Jack Server
  2. load Unity and start Game
  3. Start Max -> Set Output Device to JackRouter
  4. in JackRouter: disconnect Max from SystemPlayback and connect to Unity
* BufferSize and SampleRate must be identical in all three parties  
<br>
  
Setup in Unity:
* one Instance of the *Jack Multiplexer* must be set on the Camera/Audio-Listener Object  
  there define the number of channels
* create Object:  
  add Audio Source component, tick Loop on  
  add Jack Source Receive script, connect Multiplexer to the Camera-object where the multiplexer resides, choose input channel (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

*Trying to implement Audio Bridge between Max and Unity*  
Several attempts failed:  


<br>  

**Unity Native SDK**  
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerNativeAudioPlugin.html  
https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/nativeaudioplugins  
https://japan.unity3d.com/unite/unite2015/files/DAY1_1900_room1_Jan.pdf  
* has a "Teleport" script which should receive External Sounds
* Demo with command line script works (written in C++)
* has a AU-Plugin for DAWs (-> works only on MAC / even on Mac didnt showed up under AU-Plugins)

<br>  
<br>

**Jack Audio Connection Kit**  
http://jackaudio.org/downloads/  
http://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html  
* enables to route freely different Applications Audio Inns + Outs  
* requires Admin Rights for installation (under Windows DLLs must be registered manually)  

<br>


to connect JACK with Unity  :  
**Jack4U**  
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/jack4u-19291
* route Audio from DAW (via ASIO) to Unity
* costs 27 Euro  

**Jack Audio for Unity**  
https://github.com/rodrigodzf/Jack-Audio-For-Unity
* Open Source / frree  
* worked on Mac partly  
* Connection kind of possible but only Error glitchy/distorted Audio recieved  
-> TO BE REVISED

### 23. November 2018 ###  
*Setting up OSC-communication between Max/MSP and Unity:*    
* MaxMSP: installed the 'CNMAT Externals' package via the package manager. (no admin rights required)  
Communication runs via the Max-Object 'OpenSoundControl'
* Unity: worked with PerilNoise sample project immediately
