* added a better mirror material through a script and a shader after this tutorial:  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD9LfpRH5Z4  
  script resource: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/MirrorReflection4  
  
  Mirror Material and script have to be put both on an object to be reflective  
  seems that it has to be attached to a plane to work the best way. (rather then volumetric shapes)  
  
* added a simple and working FreeFly Camera Script  
  possible now to look around with the mouse and move via the WASD keys  
  resource: https://gist.github.com/gunderson/d7f096bd07874f31671306318019d996  
  (resp. used a modified version by Ryan Breaker found in the comments below)  
  
* played around with post-processing profile > trippy results  
  (e.g. motion blur: increase frame blending / chrom aberration: up to max / color grading: hue shifting around)  
  
  found some resources in order to automate the behaviour.  
  unity-manual: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Manipulating-the-Stack  
  a promising forum post: https://answers.unity.com/questions/1355103/modifying-the-new-post-processing-stack-through-co.html

installed Unity at Workstation at home.  
(Version 2017.4.18f because 2018 requires at least OSX 10.11) 

* Added Video-Test-World project.  
* Wrote a script that slightly transforms the World-Sphere (with 360Â°-Video)
  and moves the ground subtle -> psychedelic effect!
  
Also installed Max 7.3.6  
(Max 8 also doesn't run on OSX 10.10)

*Breakthrough: Audio Bridge WORKING*    
Using **Jack Audio for Unity**:
* reason not clear - maybe application start order crucial:
  1. Start Jack Server
  2. load Unity and start Game
  3. Start Max -> Set Output Device to JackRouter
  4. in JackRouter: disconnect Max from SystemPlayback and connect to Unity
* BufferSize and SampleRate must be identical in all three parties  
<br>
  
Setup in Unity:
* one Instance of the *Jack Multiplexer* must be set on the Camera/Audio-Listener Object  
  there define the number of channels
* create Object:  
  add Audio Source component, tick Loop on  
  add Jack Source Receive script, connect Multiplexer to the Camera-object where the multiplexer resides, choose input channel (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

*Trying to implement Audio Bridge between Max and Unity*  
Several attempts failed:  


<br>  

**Unity Native SDK**  
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerNativeAudioPlugin.html  
https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/nativeaudioplugins  
https://japan.unity3d.com/unite/unite2015/files/DAY1_1900_room1_Jan.pdf  
* has a "Teleport" script which should receive External Sounds
* Demo with command line script works (written in C++)
* has a AU-Plugin for DAWs (-> works only on MAC / even on Mac didnt showed up under AU-Plugins)

<br>  
<br>

**Jack Audio Connection Kit**  
http://jackaudio.org/downloads/  
http://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html  
* enables to route freely different Applications Audio Inns + Outs  
* requires Admin Rights for installation (under Windows DLLs must be registered manually)  

<br>


to connect JACK with Unity  :  
**Jack4U**  
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/jack4u-19291
* route Audio from DAW (via ASIO) to Unity
* costs 27 Euro  

**Jack Audio for Unity**  
https://github.com/rodrigodzf/Jack-Audio-For-Unity
* Open Source / frree  
* worked on Mac partly  
* Connection kind of possible but only Error glitchy/distorted Audio recieved  
-> TO BE REVISED

*Miscellaneous*  
The Conductor  
OCS - Communication (mainly to have a vitual interface in Unity to control parameters in Max/Live  
https://github.com/cgfarmer4/TheConductor

### 23. November 2018 ###  
*Setting up OSC-communication between Max/MSP and Unity:*    
* MaxMSP: installed the 'CNMAT Externals' package via the package manager. (no admin rights required)  
Communication runs via the Max-Object 'OpenSoundControl'
* Unity: worked with PerilNoise sample project immediately
