### 13. January 2019 ###  
installed Unity at Workstation at home.  
(Version 2017.4.18f because 2018 requires at least OSX 10.11) 

* Added Video-Test-World project.  
* Wrote a script that slightly transforms the World-Sphere (with 360Â°-Video)
  and moves the ground subtle -> psychedelic effect!

*Breakthrough: Audio Bridge WORKING*    
Using **Jack Audio for Unity**:
* reason not clear - maybe application start order crucial:
  1. Start Jack Server
  2. load Unity and start Game
  3. Start Max -> Set Output Device to JackRouter
  4. in JackRouter: disconnect Max from SystemPlayback and connect to Unity
* BufferSize and SampleRate must be identical in all three parties  
<br>
  
Setup in Unity:
* one Instance of the *Jack Multiplexer* must be set on the Camera/Audio-Listener Object  
  there define the number of channels
* create Object:  
  add Audio Source component, tick Loop on  
  add Jack Source Receive script, connect Multiplexer to the Camera-object where the multiplexer resides, choose input channel (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

*Trying to implement Audio Bridge between Max and Unity*  
Several attempts failed:  


<br>  

**Unity Native SDK**  
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerNativeAudioPlugin.html  
https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/nativeaudioplugins  
https://japan.unity3d.com/unite/unite2015/files/DAY1_1900_room1_Jan.pdf  
* has a "Teleport" script which should receive External Sounds
* Demo with command line script works (written in C++)
* has a AU-Plugin for DAWs (-> works only on MAC / even on Mac didnt showed up under AU-Plugins)

<br>  
<br>

**Jack Audio Connection Kit**  
http://jackaudio.org/downloads/  
http://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html  
* enables to route freely different Applications Audio Inns + Outs  
* requires Admin Rights for installation (under Windows DLLs must be registered manually)  

<br>


to connect JACK with Unity  :  
**Jack4U**  
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/jack4u-19291
* route Audio from DAW (via ASIO) to Unity
* costs 27 Euro  

**Jack Audio for Unity**  
https://github.com/rodrigodzf/Jack-Audio-For-Unity
* Open Source / frree  
* worked on Mac partly  
* Connection kind of possible but only Error glitchy/distorted Audio recieved  
-> TO BE REVISED

### 23. November 2018 ###  
*Setting up OSC-communication between Max/MSP and Unity:*    
* MaxMSP: installed the 'CNMAT Externals' package via the package manager. (no admin rights required)  
Communication runs via the Max-Object 'OpenSoundControl'
* Unity: worked with PerilNoise sample project immediately
